  <h2>Iron Man</h2>
  <p><a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Man" target="_blank">Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark</a> is a genius, billionaire,
    philanthropist and the former head of Stark Industries.
    Using his own great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge,
    Stark enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until
    he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings. With his life on the
    line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to
    escape his captors, returning home and becoming the
    armored superhero known as Iron Man, battling against
    terrorists as well as his former business partner
    Obadiah Stane. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with
    his new secret identity and decided to share it with
    the world, publicly announcing himself as Iron Man.
