  <h2>Captain America</h2>
  <p><a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Captain_America" target="_blank">Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers</a> is a World War II veteran,
    and is known as the world's first superhero. Born within
    Brooklyn, New York City, the young Rogers had suffered from
    numerous health problems, and upon America's entry into World
    War II, was rejected from military service despite several
    attempts to enlist. Determined to serve, he ultimately
    volunteered for the top-secret Super Soldier program, and
    the frail Rogers was then enhanced to the peak of human
    perfection. Rogers soon joined the war effort as the mascot,
    given the new moniker of Captain America, and later joined
    the war with a combat role after he single-handedly liberated
    captured Allied POWs.
